Project Overview:
A Blog CMS allows users (administrators or blog writers) to create, edit, and delete blog posts. Visitors can view the list of posts, read individual posts, and maybe leave comments. The CMS would include an admin panel for managing blog content.

Tech Stack:
Frontend: Next.js (for fast server-side rendering and dynamic routing) + TailwindCSS (for styling)
Backend: Django or Flask (for creating and managing the API and database)
Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL (for managing blog posts, users, and comments)
Auth: You can use Django’s built-in authentication system or implement JWT authentication with Flask for securing the admin panel.
Features:
Public Pages:

Homepage: Displays a list of blog posts with a preview (title, short description, date, and author).
Post Page: Displays the full content of the post, along with the author name and the date.
Categories/Tags: Option to filter blog posts by category or tags.
Admin Panel:

Login/Authentication: Admin can log in to manage content.
Create/Edit/Delete Posts: Admin can create new blog posts, edit existing ones, or delete them.
Rich Text Editor: Use a rich text editor (like TinyMCE or Quill.js) to format the content of blog posts.
Post Management: Admin can view a list of all posts with options to edit, delete, or create new posts.
Optional Features:

Comments Section: Readers can leave comments on blog posts. Admin can moderate or delete comments.
Search Functionality: Allow users to search for blog posts by keyword.
User Registration (Optional): Readers can create accounts and receive notifications when new posts are published.
Backend Setup (Flask):

Set up routes for handling blog posts and an API (using Flask-RESTful).
Handle user authentication using Flask-JWT-Extended or Flask-Security for admin access.
Set up a SQLAlchemy database with models similar to Django.
Frontend (Next.js):
Homepage: Fetch blog posts from the backend API and display them in a list format.

Post Page: Use dynamic routing in Next.js (/post/[id]) to fetch and display individual post details.

Admin Panel: Build pages for managing posts, which are only accessible to authenticated users.

Database Structure:
You’ll need a few tables/models:

User: To handle admin authentication.
Post: For blog posts.
Category: For organizing posts into categories.
Comment (optional): For managing comments on posts.
Deployment:
Frontend: Deploy the Next.js frontend to Vercel or Netlify.
Backend: Deploy Django or Flask on Heroku, DigitalOcean, or any cloud provider of your choice.
Database: Use PostgreSQL or MySQL, either hosted (like AWS RDS, Heroku Postgres) or on the same server as your backend.
This project is small but useful, and it can be expanded with additional features like comments, user profiles, and more.
